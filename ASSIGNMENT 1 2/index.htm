    <h1>The Joy Of Escaping Through Books</h1>
    <p>Reading is one of my favorite hobbies because it allows me to escape into different worlds and explore new ideas. Whether it's fiction, non-fiction, fantasy, or history, each book offers a unique experience and perspective. I enjoy getting lost in stories, meeting interesting characters, and learning about places and cultures I might never encounter in real life. Reading helps me relax, improves my focus, and sparks my imagination in ways few other activities can.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Learning and Growing Through Reading</h3>
    <p>Another reason I love reading is that it's both entertaining and educational. With just a book and a quiet corner, I can dive into complex topics, expand my vocabulary, and improve my critical thinking skills. <b>"It’s a hobby I can enjoy alone, at my own pace, and it never feels like time wasted."</b> Over the years, reading has become not just a pastime, but a vital part of my daily routine that keeps me grounded and inspired.</p>

     <h2>Allama Iqbal:-</h2>
     <p>Allama Muhammad Iqbal was a great philosopher, poet, and politician in British India who played a significant role in inspiring the Muslims of the subcontinent. Born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot (now in Pakistan), he received his early education in Lahore and later went to Europe for higher studies, earning degrees from the University of Cambridge and a doctorate from the University of Munich. Iqbal’s poetry, written in Persian and Urdu, carries deep philosophical and spiritual messages. He emphasized self-awareness, unity, and the revival of Islamic civilization. One of his most famous concepts is “Khudi,” meaning selfhood or self-realization, which encourages individuals to recognize their potential and dignity.

     Iqbal is also known as the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan" because of his vision for a separate homeland for Muslims, which he expressed in his historic Allahabad address in 1930. His poetry inspired millions and contributed greatly to the ideological foundation of Pakistan. Works like Bang-e-Dra, Asrar-e-Khudi, and Payam-e-Mashriq remain influential to this day. He passed away on April 21, 1938, but his ideas continue to guide and inspire people across the world. Allama Iqbal’s legacy is one of intellect, inspiration, and deep love for his nation and religion.</p>

       <br>

Through his wisdom, leadership, and determination, he led the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent to achieve a separate homeland where they could live in peace and practice their religion freely. He is rightfully known as “Quaid-e-Azam,” which means “Great Leader.”</p>
      
      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi. He received his early education in Karachi and Bombay (now Mumbai). At the age of 16, he went to England to study law and became a barrister. During his time in London, he was deeply influenced by British political values such as justice, democracy, and equality.</p>

      <h2>Political Career and Leadership</h2>
      <p>Jinnah started his political career with the Indian National Congress but later joined the All-India Muslim League because he realized that Muslims were not given equal rights in India.

      Jinnah believed in constitutional methods, democracy, and peaceful negotiation. With his clear vision and powerful arguments, he became the voice of millions of Muslims. He led the Pakistan Movement with great dedication and faced many challenges, but he never gave up.</p>

      <h2>Creation of Pakistan</h2>
      <p>Jinnah’s tireless efforts led to the creation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. He became the first Governor-General of the new country. In his famous speech on August 11, 1947, he spoke about religious freedom, equality, and justice, setting the foundation for a democratic Pakistan. His dream was of a modern, progressive, and inclusive state.</p>

      <h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
      <p>Quaid-e-Azam passed away on September 11, 1948, just a year after Pakistan’s independence. Though his life was short after independence, his role as the founder of Pakistan remains unforgettable. His honesty, discipline, and leadership continue to inspire generations.</p>
